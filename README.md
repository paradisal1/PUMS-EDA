# PUMS-EDA

This is a shortened version of an exploratory data analysis project I did as an intern at the Polis Center. The project explores PUMS survey data, which is a large dataset produced by the Census Bureau. The objective was to calculate communal well being metrics in Indiana for quality assurance purposes. The Polis Center uses R for calculations; I was asked to use Python.
