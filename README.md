# PUMS-EDA

This is a shortened version of an exploratory data analysis project I did as an intern at the Polis Center. The project explores PUMS survey data, which is a large dataset produced by the Census Bureau. The objective was to calculate communal well being metrics in Indiana for quality assurance purposes. The Polis Center uses R for calculations; I was asked to use Python.

In the original version of this project I made recommendations regarding the Polis Center's data sourcing practices. There are two versions of the PUMS dataset, PUMS and IPUMS. PUMS is the original data from the Census Bureau while IPUMS sources their data from PUMS. The primary difference between the two is that IPUMS takes great effort to harmonize PUMS data over time and geography. This is desirable because researchers can study changes and make deeper comparisons. Moreover, The Census Bureau often changes variables names from year to year.
